FiftyOne Datasets are the core data structure in FiftyOne, allowing you to
represent your data and manipulate it through the Python library and the
:doc:`FiftyOne App <app>`.

What is a FiftyOne Dataset?
---------------------------

FiftyOne Datasets allow you to easily :doc:`load <dataset_creation/index>`,
:doc:`modify <using_datasets>` and :doc:`visualize <app>` your data along with
any related labels (classification, detection, etc). It provides a way to
easily load images, annotations, and model predictions into a format that can
be visualized in the FiftyOne App.

If you have your own collection of data, loading it as a |Dataset| will allow
you to easily search and sort your samples. You can use FiftyOne to identify
unique samples as well as possible mistakes in your labels.

If you are training a model, the output predictions and logits can be loaded
into your |Dataset|. The FiftyOne App makes it easy to visually debug what
your model has learned, even for complex label types like detection and
segmentation masks. With this knowledge, you can update your |Dataset| to
include more representative samples and samples that your model found difficult
into your training set.

.. note::
    Check out :doc:`creating FiftyOne datasets <dataset_creation/index>` for
    more information about loading your data into FiftyOne.

A |Dataset| is composed of multiple |Sample| objects which contain |Field|
attributes, all of which can be dynamically created, modified and deleted.
FiftyOne uses a lightweight non-relational database to store datasets, so you
can easily scale to datasets of any size without worrying about RAM
constraints on your machine.

Datasets are **ordered collections** of samples. When a |Sample| is added to a
|Dataset|, it is assigned a unique ID that can be used to retrieve the sample
from the dataset.

Slicing and other batch operations on datasets are done through the use of
:doc:`DatasetViews <using_views>`. A |DatasetView| provides an ordered
view into the |Dataset|, which can be filtered, sorted, sampled, etc. along
various axes to obtain a desired subset of the samples.

Samples
-------

Samples are the atomic elements of a |Dataset| that store all the information
related to a given piece of data (e.g., an image).

All |Sample| instances store the path to their source data on disk in their
`filepath` field. Any number of fields can be dynamically added to samples to
store additional custom information about the sample.

.. custombutton::
    :button_text: Learn more about using samples
    :button_link: using_datasets.html#using-samples

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import fiftyone as fo

   sample = fo.Sample(filepath="/path/to/image.png")

Fields
------

Fields are attributes of |Sample| instances that store customizable information
about the samples. Thinking of a |Dataset| as a table where each row is a
|Sample|, each column of the table is a |Field|.

All samples must have their `filepath` field populated, which points to the
source data for the sample on disk. By default, samples are also given `id`,
`metadata`, and `tags` fields that can store common information.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo

    sample = fo.Sample(filepath="path/to/image.png")

    print(sample)

.. code-block:: text

    <Sample: {
        'id': None,
        'filepath': 'path/to/image.png',
        'tags': [],
        'metadata': None,
    }>

Fields can be dynamically created, modified, and deleted. When a new |Field|
is assigned to a |Sample| in a |Dataset|, it is automatically added to the
dataset's schema and thus accessible on all other samples in the dataset. If
a |Field| is unset on a particular |Sample|, its value will be `None`.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import fiftyone as fo

    sample = fo.Sample(filepath="path/to/image.png")

    sample["quality"] = 89.7
    sample["keypoints"] = [[31, 27], [63, 72]]
    sample["geo_json"] = {
        "type": "Feature",
        "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [125.6, 10.1]},
        "properties": {"name": "camera"},
    }

    print(sample)

.. code-block:: text

    <Sample: {
        'id': None,
        'filepath': 'path/to/image.png',
        'tags': [],
        'metadata': None,
        'quality': 89.7,
        'keypoints': [[31, 27], [63, 72]],
        'geo_json': {
            'type': 'Feature',
            'geometry': {'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [125.6, 10.1]},
            'properties': {'name': 'camera'},
        },
    }>

Tags
----

Tags are a default |Field| provided on all |Sample| instances. The `tags`
attribute of a |Sample| stores a list of strings that can be used flexibly to
store information about a sample.

A typical use case is to tag the dataset split (`test`, `train`, `validation`)
to which the |Sample| belongs. However, you are free to use tags however you
like.

    import fiftyone as fo

    sample = fo.Sample(filepath="path/to/image.png", tags=["train"])
    sample.tags.append("my_favorite_samples")

    print(sample.tags)
    # ["train", "my_favorite_samples"]

Metadata
--------

Metadata  is a default |Field| provided on all |Sample| instances. The
`metadata` attribute of a |Sample| stores data type-specific metadata about the
raw data in the sample.

    metadata = fo.ImageMetadata.build_for(image_path)

    sample = fo.Sample(filepath=image_path, metadata=metadata)
    print(sample)

.. code-block:: text

    <Sample: {
        'id': None,
        'filepath': '/path/to/image.png',
        'tags': [],
        'metadata': <ImageMetadata: {
            'size_bytes': 544559,
            'mime_type': 'image/png',
            'width': 698,
            'height': 664,
            'num_channels': 3,
        }>,
    }>

Labels
------

Labels store semantic information about the sample, such as ground annotations
or model predictions.

FiftyOne provides a |Label| subclass for common tasks:

- :ref:`Classification <classification>`: a classification label
- :ref:`Classifications <multilabel-classification>`: a list of classifications (typically for multilabel tasks)
- :ref:`Detections <object-detection>`: a list of object detections
- :ref:`ImageLabels <multitask-predictions>`: a generic collection of multitask predictions for an image

                }>,
            ]),
        }>,
    }>

DatasetViews
------------

Dataset views are a powerful tool for exploring your datasets. You can use
|DatasetView| instances to search, filter, sort, and manipulate subsets of your
datasets to perform the analysis that you need.
